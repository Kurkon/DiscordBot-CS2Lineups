A discordbot that is used to send cs2 lineups for grenades which is stored in different discord text channels.

The bot is made to answer in swedish in it's own answers. 

To use the bot, enter you need to enter the bots token in the config.json file aswell as the channelIDs for the different text channels for the different maps.
After sending tiktok, youtube or really any link, tagging it with the type of nade and location of the grenade it's good to go. 
Use commands like "-dust2 smoke short" and the bot should respond with a corresponding lineup. It works best with the following setup:

Discord text channels:
# bot
# ancient
# anubis
# dust2
# inferno
# mirage
# nuke

Use the bot channel to do the commands and the map channels to store and tag the lineups.
